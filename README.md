Download the .csv files and load them in Microsoft Excel or Google sheets. 
Fill in your step count data and target step count and download the files **in .csv format***. 
Ensure that the R script is in the same folder as the downloaded .csv files and run the script. 
Hopefully, you should have a graph of your daily step count in comparison to your step goals.
